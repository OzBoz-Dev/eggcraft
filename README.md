### Items
  
- Fried Egg: A good food source, cook an egg on a campfire to craft.
  
- Burnt Egg: Cook an egg in a furnace (I mean, would you microwave an egg IRL?). Applies the Smelly effect.
  - Smelly: Causes all nearby entities to rapidly flee from the player.

- Special Syringe: Extract Strange Serum from a Mysterious Egg by holding right click.
  
- Eggshell: Crafting material, can be placed on the ground to create a hazard, which does damage (attributed to the nearest player) that also scales off the number of eggshells on the block (up to 9). Designed for mob farms, and can be replenished by dispensers.
  
- Eggshell Armor: Can completely absorb one hit of damage before breaking. Utilizes a mixin to cancel the damage function when an entity wears it.
  
- Eggs In A Basket: Comes in many variants, requiring different gadget eggs to craft. Gives various status effects when held in your off hand at the cost of durability every second, including an all new Reach effect. Right click to briefly amplify the granted effect.
  - Reach: Extends player block and entity interaction range, further with higher levels.
  
- Templates: Used in the Etching Station to craft powerful gadget eggs. Can only craft a certain amount of eggs.
